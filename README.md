# Smart Breaker
 Keeps power running, when away or outside of the grid after a period of time.
 
 ## Requirements:
 - 1 Programmable Block (**name:** pb)
 
 - 1 Sensor (**name:** MarcoPolo)
 
 - 1 Timer Block (**name:** SmartBreaker)

 - 1 Scifi Button Panel (**name:** Departure Panel)
 
 - 1 Battery
 
At any given time, all 4 of these blocks must remain on. If the server is set to turn off blocks due to inactivity, any one of these blocks can interrupt the process
disabling the script. If the 4 hours is the MAX inactivity time, then setting to 3hr 30min would reset the inactivity timer keeping the functional blocks running. This
has been preset to:

tblock.TriggerDelay = 10800.
